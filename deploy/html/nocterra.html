                NOCTERRA written by Scott Snyder with art by Tony S. Daniel and Tomeu Morey—Imagine that tomorrow the
                sun simply doesn't rise. You wait. And you wait, but night just continues... You can still feel the
                sun's warmth –it must BE THERE– but for some reason, light no longer reaches the earth. And this new
                darkness, there's something strange about it, something terrifying. Because anything (or anyone) that
                stays in it too long starts to change…

                Nocterra takes place ten years after the world is plunged into an everlasting night that turns all
                living creatures into monstrous “shades.” The only way to survive is to stay close to artificial light.
                There are rumors of sanctuaries –perpetually-lit bunkers– where the shade-transformation can even be
                reversed, but most people assume these are just legends. Enter Valentina “Val” Riggs, a skilled
                “ferryman” who transports people and goods along deadly unlit roads with her heavily illuminated
                eighteen-wheeler.

                When an old man promising sanctuary offers Val a job to drive him and his granddaughter up through the
                Rocky Mountains, she takes it, hoping there might be some truth to his claim. What she finds in the end,
                though, is something much more horrifying than any shade…
