      <h5>
        We Have Demons features widescreen action and the kinds of jaw-dropping storytelling twists that have made Scott
        Snyder and Greg Capullo the bestselling creator duo of the last 25 years.
        <br><br>
        In every folklore throughout history, there’s a struggle between “angels” and “demons” – between beings of
        goodness and monstrous beings of darkness. But what if this
        struggle, this war for the soul of humanity, wasn’t rooted in the mystical or supernatural, but in science?
        <br><br>
        Our hero, Lam was named after the first female angel, “Lamassu.” She never really understood herfather’s
        devotion to their small-town Unitarian church. And when he dies under mysterious circumstances, she starts to
        question everything she thought she knew. One night, a distraught Lam visits her father’s church looking for
        answers. What she finds there is a monster: a hulking demon named Chopper who claims to have worked with her
        father and now offers to work with her to solve her father's murder.
        <br><br>
        We Have Demons is full throttle entertainment by two comic book megastars, featuring action, conspiracies,
        secret organizations, monsters, mayhem, and a climactic war of good and evil with no less than the fate of the
        universe hanging in the balance.
