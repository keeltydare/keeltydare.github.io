        Scott Snyder and Jock—the creative team of the New York Times bestselling
        blockbuster The Batman Who Laughs—reunite for a young adult horror graphic
        novel. The Book of Evil tells the story of four young friends growing up in a strange,
        near future where over 90% of the population are born as psychopaths…
        <br><br>
        Imagine a world where nearly every baby born is a future psychopath. Is this
        human evolution? A virus? Can it be cured? Regardless, just like that, the new normal
        is psychopathy.
        <br><br>
        Quinn is a curious, quiet, and determined 12-year-old boy—and an artist. The story of
        The Book of Evil unfolds in first person narration from Quinn’s point of view, featuring
        his journal entries, alongside his illustrations from his journey – as well as excerpts of
        his father’s cartoon strip called “The Book of Evil.” His father’s popular cartoon
        featured an everyman named Everett who time traveled, met heroic figures of the
        past, and murdered them in hyper-violent ways. Was Quinn’s father telling a story to
        entertain? Or was he leaving clues in “The Book of Evil” for those, like his son and his
        friends, looking to change the world?
        <br><br>
        The Book of Evil is ambitious storytelling, featuring a unique combination of prose and
        multiple styles of illustration, by two of the most popular creators working in comics
        today.
