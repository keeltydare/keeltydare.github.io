                <span>Clear</span> written by Scott Snyder with art and colors by Francis Manapul—Welcome to a world where people are able to connect to the internet like never
                before, where a neurological internet connection is transforming reality. Welcome
                to the world of Clear.
                <br><br>
                A dazzling, sci-fi thrill ride into a strange dystopian future, in Clear, people
                connect to the internet neurologically and mediate the real world through the
                lenses of their eyes. Everything can be skinned to fit your preferences. There are
                custom skins for steampunk, old fashioned Hollywood glamour, and
                pornographic and fetish fantasies. If you can name it, you can live it. You choose
                how you see the world and no one knows what you’re seeing.
                <br><br>
                In San Francisco, private detective Sam Dunes is working a case for a wealthy
                woman, spying on her husband, making sure the man isn’t buying illegal
                untraceable filters to make his wife look like someone else.
                <br><br>
                Dunes has just finished tangling with the filter dealers when his old partner, tells
                him about the alleged suicide… of his ex-wife. When Dunes receives a gift from
                his dead ex-wife in the mail, Sam finds himself pulled into a wild and twisting
                mystery that stretches from the city’s deadly underworld to the even deadlier
                heights of the city’s wealthy and powerful elite.
