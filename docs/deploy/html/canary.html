            <h5>
              In 1891 a mine collapsed into itself. What was the dark substance found 666 feet
              underground? Blending modern horror, historical fact and Western lore, Scott
              Snyder and Dan Panosian have created a uniquely terrifying thriller with Canary.
              <br><br>
              During the final days of the Gold Rush, one mining company in Colorado, pulled
              up radioactive Uranium, and then the mine then collapsed in on itself. Legends
              sprung up about the mine being cursed or even haunted.
              <br><br>
              Now the Frontier is closed, the gold and silver mines have dried up. The country
              is becoming “civilized,” and yet in one stretch of the Rocky Mountains, a
              terrifying, new kind of violence is suddenly emerging. Random killings. People
              going mad and murdering neighbors, classmates without real cause. When a
              schoolboy kills his teacher with a hatchet, a famous federal marshal named Azrael
              William Holt is called in to investigate the killings. What he--and a brilliant young
              geologist--uncover is stranger and more horrifying than anything they could have
              ever imagined.

                    <span>Daniel Duke Panosian</span> hails from Cleveland, Ohio and lives in Los Angeles, California with his wife
                    and son. If he had a pet he would have mentioned it in the first sentence. But he doesn’t. Without
                    the company of a friendly animal, he began working for Marvel and DC Comics which led him to Image
                    Comics. From there he branched out into the video game world and eventually Film and TV. But the
                    lure of comic books was too great and once again he was back in its lovely full color embrace. Not
                    content with merely making a living drawing, he co-created “Drink and Draw,” a popular social
                    network of artists that gather at bars, taverns and lounges. In 2018 he created Slots for Image
                    Comics with Skybound Entertainment. In 2020 he created An Unkindness of Ravens for BOOM! Studios and
                    is a regular cover artist for Marvel and DC Comics. Sure, he’s won awards, but his true win is every
                    smile he’s received from a collection of stick figure illustrations he’s produced in chalk outside
                    his doorstep.
