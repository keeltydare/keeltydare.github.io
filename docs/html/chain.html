      <h5>
        <span>Chain</span>â€”Welcome to Whitebear, Alaska, just a thousand miles south of the North Pole. The population
        in summer is about two hundred. In winter, when the temperature regularly hits twenty below zero, the population
        dwindles to about twenty. Josephine ("Joe") Widjaja is a year-rounder. At 30 years old, she runs a small depot for
        prop planes out in the snow. She's tough, independent, and haunted by a past she doesn't want to talk about. But
        that's fine, because Whitebear is a place for loners, people who've opted out of a conventional life. Ice
        truckers and hippies, maybe a student from the marine biology center. It's a quiet, beautiful, tough life. And
        Joe likes it that way. But all that changes one night when a helicopter crashes near her depot. Not just any
        helicopter, either -- this one was carrying the richest man in the world, tech impresario Del Dison. A wounded
        Dison is brought to the local bar, where the other residents of Whitebear are gathered for a start of winter
        party. Here, a wounded Dison issues a warning to the town. In a matter of hours, a virus released into the air
        years ago will cause the food chain to essentially invert. Insects, birds, fish, every few hours another strata
        will turn on man, until every living creature is trying to kill us. Even as he tells Joe and the residents of
        Whitebear about what's coming, the news reports start...insects, swarming people around the world. But Dison has
        an offer for the townsfolk, one that just might save them, or cause them to tear each other apart.

        Chain is a tense, claustrophobic thriller set against the end of the world. Beautifully illustrated by Ariela
        Kristantina, it's a take you won't soon forget.
