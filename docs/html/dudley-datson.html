                <span>Dudley Datson and the Forever Machine</span> written by Scott Snyder with art by Jamal Igle and Juan Castro and
                colors by Chris Sotomayor—Throughout history, the world’s greatest engineers have tried, and failed, to
                create the perpetual motion machine – a machine that could open doorways
                through space-time and other terrifying realities. But what if a perpetual motion
                machine had been created? A machine this powerful would need to be the
                world’s most guarded secret. And for as long as it has existed, “the Forever
                Machine” has been pursued by the Needle’s Eye, a group of the rich, powerful
                and nefarious who seek to use it to fulfill their own desires…
                <br><br>
                Enter Dudley Datson, a science-loving geek who goes to a school for gifted kids
                in Brooklyn, NY. His closest friend is his science teacher, Dr. Adara Shae. She’s
                brilliant and well known around the world, doing a residency at Dudley’s school,
                and recognizes his promise. She’s also the current protector of the Forever
                Machine…
                <br><br>
                After the Needle’s Eye catches up to her, a dying Dr. Shae passses the Forever
                Machine to Dudley. And where the machine goes, its guardian mechanical dog
                Daedalus follows. Full of gadgets and tricks, able to speak, Daedalus becomes
                Dudley’s protector as they struggle to keep the Forever Machine away from the
                Needle’s Eye.
